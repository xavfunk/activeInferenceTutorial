## Active Inference Tutorial

based on A step-by-step tutorial on active inference and its application to
empirical data, Smith et al. 2022

## TODO
- [x] Make EFE_Precision_Updating work in python 
- [x] compare with matlab
- [x] play with it and understand it 
- [x] punch through iteration update equations on p 20
- [] look at their derivation in https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006267
- [x] Make VFE_calculation_example.m work in python
- [x] play with it and understand it 
- [x] find and punch through the corresponding equations
- [] understand variational message passing (is this the sum-product algorithm?) Continue at p19 1.Initialize (take notes and code) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00095/full
- [] have a look at marginal message passing https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38246-3
- [] make Message_passing_example.m work in python
- [] play with it and understand it
